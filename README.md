# StressTesting
This project was designed about half a year ago.

It's used for  stress testing for website.

You can enter your web url and fruquency.

I want to create a GUI for this project, but there are some errors in my environment.

So I use colab and connect it to github

The main feature is [grequests](https://github.com/spyoungtech/grequests).
I add some code in this package.
